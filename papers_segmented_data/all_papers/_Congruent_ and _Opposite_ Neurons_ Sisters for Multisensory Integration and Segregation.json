These sensory systems extract information about the environment via different physical means, and they generate complementary cues (neural representations) about external objects to the multisensory areas. Over the past years, a large volume of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on investigating how the brain integrates multiple sensory cues originated from the same object in order to perceive the object reliably in an ambiguous environment, the so-called multisensory integration. They found that the brain can integrate multiple cues optimally in a manner close to Bayesian inference, e.g., integrating visual and vestibular cues to infer heading direction [1] and so on [2][3][4]. Neural circuit models underlying optimal multisensory integration have been proposed, including a centralized model in which a dedicated processor receives and integrates all sensory cues [5,6], and a decentralized model in which multiple local processors exchange cue information via reciprocal connections, so that optimal cue integration is achieved at each local processor [7].  [1], (C) from [13].\nHowever, multisensory integration is only half of the story of multisensory information processing, which works well when the sensory cues are originated from the same object. In cases where the sensory cues originate from different objects, the brain should segregate, rather than integrate, the cues. In a noisy environment, however, the brain is unable to differentiate the two situations at first sight. The brain faces a \"chicken vs. egg\" dilemma in multisensory integration: without first integrating multiple cues to eliminate uncertainty, the brain is unable to estimate the objects reliably to differentiate whether the cues are from the same or different objects; but once the cues are integrated, the disparity information between the cues is lost, and the brain can no longer discriminate objects clearly when the cues actually come from different objects. To solve this dilemma, here we argue that the brain needs to carry out multisensory integration and segregation concurrently in the early stage of information processing, that is, a group of neurons integrates sensory cues while another group of neurons extracts the cue disparity information, and the interplay between two networks determines the final action: integration vs. segregation. Concurrent processing has the advantage of achieving rapid object perception if the cues are indeed from the same object, and avoiding information loss if the cues are from different objects. Psychophysical data tends to support this idea, which shows that the brain can still sense the difference between cues in multisensory integration [8,9].\nWhat are the neural substrates of the brain to implement concurrent multisensory integration and segregation? In the experiments of integrating visual and vestibular cues to infer heading direction, it was found that in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) which primarily receive visual and vestibular cues respectively, there exist two types of neurons displaying different cue integrative behaviors [1,10]. One of them is called \"congruent\" cells, since their preferred heading directions are similar in response to either a visual or a vestibular cue (Fig. 1A); and the other type is called \"opposite\" cells, since their preferred visual and vestibular directions are nearly \"opposite\" (with an offset of 180 \u2022 , half of the period of direction, Fig. 1B). Data analyses and modelling studies revealed that congruent neurons are responsible for cue integration [1,10,6,7]. However, the computational role of opposite neurons remains largely unknown, despite the fact that congruent and opposite neurons are comparably numerous in MSTd and VIP (Fig. 1C). Notably, the responses of opposite neurons hardly vary when a single cue is replaced by two congruent cues (i.e., no cue integration behavior), whereas their responses increase significantly when the disparity between visual and vestibular cues increases [11], indicating that opposite neurons may serve to extract the cue disparity information necessary for multisensory segregation. Motivated by the above experimental findings, we explore how multisensory integration and segregation are concurrently implemented in a neural system via sisters of congruent and opposite cells.", "Introduction", "introduction"], ["025b2500986a070ec5f5d4b0021a52e7e7aa67fc_2", "In reality, because of noise, the brain estimates stimulus information relying on ambiguous cues in a probabilistic manner.

Experimental data revealed that our brain integrates sensory cues optimally in a manner close to Bayesian inference [2]. Assuming that noises in different channels are independent, the posterior distribution of two stimuli can be written according to Bayes' theorem as\np(s 1 , s 2 |x 1 , x 2 ) \u221d p(x 1 |s 1 )p(x 2 |s 2 )p(s 1 , s 2 ),(2)\nwhere p(s 1 , s 2 ) is the prior of the stimuli, which specifies the concurrence probability of a stimulus pair.

Such a tendency has been modeled in multisensory integration [7,[15][16][17]. \u03ba s determines the correlation between two stimuli, i.e., how informative one cue is about the other, and it regulates the extent to which two cues should be integrated. The fully integrated case, in which the prior becomes a delta function in the limit \u03ba s \u2192 \u221e, has been modeled in e.g., [4,5].\nSince the results for two stimuli are exchangeable, hereafter, we will only present the result for s 1 , unless stated specifically. Noting that p(s m ) = p(x m ) = 1/2\u03c0 are uniform distributions, the posterior distribution of s 1 given two cues becomes\np(s 1 |x 1 , x 2 ) \u221d p(x 1 |s 1 ) p(x 2 |s 2 )p(s 2 |s 1 )ds 2 \u221d p(s 1 |x 1 )p(s 1 |x 2 ).(4)\nThe indirect cue x 2 is informative to s 1 via the prior p(s 1 , s 2 ). By using Eqs.

Inspired by the observation in multisensory integration that the posterior of a stimulus given combined cues is the product of the posteriors given each cue (Eq.4), we propose that in multisensory segregation, the disparity D(s 1 |x 1 ; s 1 |x 2 ) between two cues is measured by the ratio of the posteriors given each cue, that is,\nD(s 1 |x 1 ; s 1 |x 2 ) \u2261 p(s 1 |x 1 )/p(s 1 |x 2 ),(9)\nBy taking the expectation of log D over the distribution p(s 1 |x 1 ), we get the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two posteriors given each cue. This disparity measure was also used to discriminate alternative moving directions in [18].\nInterestingly, by utilizing the property of von Mises distributions and the condition cos(s 1 +\u03c0 \u2212x 2 ) = \u2212 cos(s 1 \u2212 x 2 ), Eq.

A von Mises distribution M (s \u2212 x, \u03ba) can be interpreted as a vector in a two-dimensional space with its mean x and concentration \u03ba representing respectively the angle and length of the vector (Fig. 2B-C). This fits well with the circular property of heading direction. When the posterior of a stimulus is interpreted as a vector, the vector length represents the confidence of inference. Interestingly, under such a geometrical interpretation, the product of two von Mises distributions equals summation of their corresponding vectors, and the ratio of two von Mises distributions equals subtraction of the two vectors. Thus, from Eq. (4), we see that multisensory integration is equivalent to vector summation, with each vector representing the posterior of the stimulus given a single cue, and from Eq. (9), multisensory segregation is equivalent to vector subtraction (see Fig. 2D).\nOverall, multisensory integration and segregation transform the original two vectors, the posteriors given each cue, into two new vectors, the posterior given combined cues and the disparity between the two cues. The original two vectors can be recovered from their linear combinations. Hence, there is no information loss. The geometrical interpretation also helps us to understand multisensory information processing intuitively. For instance, if two vectors have a small intersection angle, i.e., the posteriors given each cue tend to support each other, the length of summed vector is long, implying that the posterior of cue integration has strong confidence; and the length of subtracting vector is short, implying that the disparity between two cues is small. If the two vectors have a large intersection angle, the interpretation becomes the opposite.", "Geometrical Interpretation of Multisensory Information Processing", "introduction"], ["025b2500986a070ec5f5d4b0021a52e7e7aa67fc_7", "We adopt a decentralized architecture to model multisensory information processing in the brain [7,19]. Compared with the centralized architecture in which a dedicated processor carries out all computations, the decentralized architecture considers a number of local processors communicating with each other via reciprocal connections, so that optimal information processing is achieved at each local processor distributively [7]. This architecture was supported by a number of experimental findings, including the involvement of multiple, rather than a single, brain areas in visual-vestibular integration [1,10], the existence of intensive reciprocal connections between MTSd and VIP [20,21], and the robustness of multisensory integration against the inactivation of a single module [22]. In a previous work [7], Zhang et al. studied a decentralized model for multisensory integration at MSTd and VIP, and demonstrated that optimal integration can be achieved at both areas simultaneously, agreeing with the experimental data. In their model, MSTd and VIP are congruently connected, i.e., neurons in one module are strongly connected to those having the similar preferred heading directions in the other module. This congruent connection pattern naturally gives rise to congruent neurons.\nSince the number of opposite neurons is comparable with that of congruent neurons in MSTd and VIP, it is plausible that they also have a computational role. It is instructive to compare the probabilistic models of multisensory integration and segregation, i.e., Eqs. (4) and (10). They have the same form, except that in segregation the stimulus value in the posterior given the indirect cue is shifted by \u03c0.
