This subtpye of metonymy, which overlaps with metaphor, has a specific syntax and is especially frequent in journalistic texts. While identifying Vossian Antonomasia is of particular interest in the study of stylistics, it is also a source of errors in relation and fact extraction as an explicitly mentioned entity occurs only metaphorically and should not be associated with respective contexts. Despite rather simple syntactic variations, the automatic extraction of VA was never addressed as yet since it requires a deeper semantic understanding of mentioned entities and underlying relations. In this paper, we propose a first method for the extraction of VAs that works completely automatically. Our approaches use named entity recognition, distant supervision based on Wikidata, and a bi-directional LSTM for postprocessing. The evaluation on 1.8 million articles of the New York Times corpus shows that our approach significantly outperforms the only existing semi-automatic approach for VA identification by more than 30 percentage points in precision.", "abstract", "abstract"], ["b7a94c0422f863b0daeaf7554434023d0517d04b_1", "Background. Vossian Antonomasia (VA) is a stylistic device which attributes a certain property to a person by naming another (more well-known, more popular) person as a reference point. For instance, when Jim Koch is described as \"the Steve Jobs of Beer\" (Fallows, 2014), certain qualities of Steve Jobs, be it entrepreneurship or persuasiveness, are assigned to Jim Koch, co-founder and chairman of the Boston Beer Company.\nVA is named after Gerardus Vossius (1577-1649), the Dutch classical scholar and author of rhetorical textbooks. Although the phenomenon is traceable back to antiquity (as shows the example of Crassus, who used to be ironically referred to as \"the Palatine Venus\"), it was first distinguished and described as a separate phenomenon by Vossius.\nIt constitutes a sub-phenomenon of the classic antonomasia. In the classification of Holmqvist and P\u0142uciennik (2010) it is called metaphorical antonomasia or antonomasia 2 and is described as a comparison \"with paragons from other spheres\". VAs are particularly popular in journalistic texts.\nDefinition. VAs consist of three parts: a source (in our example \"Steve Jobs\") serves as paragon to elevate the target (\"Jim Koch\") by applying a modifier (\"of beer\") that provides the corresponding context (see Bergien, 2013). Although in most cases both the source and the target are persons, one or both of them could be almost anything as long as they bear a proper name, for instance, software, as shows this example: \"Word [. . . ] was dubbed the Marquis de Sade of word processors, which was not altogether unfair.\" (NYT 1993/09/26/0636952) 1 The target is not necessarily part of the sentence (in particular when a VA is used in a headline -like in the title of this paper 2 ) and it can be hypothetical, as in \"Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus?\" (NYT 1988/01/03/0106769) Challenges. Despite some interest in VAs in the humanities (e.g., Holmqvist and P\u0142uciennik, 2010;Bergien, 2013), works on their automatic extraction are scarce. One reason could be that \"antonomasia is essentially humanistic and anti-computational\" (Holmqvist and P\u0142uciennik, 2010) and thus identifying and understanding it in its entirety is often difficult even for humans and requires deep cultural background knowledge. For example, understanding the phrase \"It's the Dolly Parton of cakes\" (NYT 2007/02/14/1826062) requires specific knowledge about Dolly Parton, her skills or peculiarities. Only in rare cases like this, an explanation of the intended meaning (\"a little bit tacky, but you love her\") is provided. It is usually left to the reader to make sense of a VA.\nImportance. From a humanities perspective, a VA constitutes an interesting phenomenon of enculturation (Holmqvist and P\u0142uciennik, 2010) that deserves to be studied more in-depth, based on larger corpora.\nHowever, we expect that the large-scale identification of VAs and other such stylistic devices is not only important in the humanities and for cultural reasons, but also in natural language processing to avoid mistakes in tasks such as machine translation and fact extraction. For instance, given the sentence \"Today, the German Ronaldo quit his career.\", we do not want to extract a fact that Ronaldo quit his career, but we need to detect that \"the German Ronaldo\" is a VA referring to a German soccer player.\nIn addition, entity disambiguation and coreference resolution could be improved. Consider the example \"Jimmy Johnson is the Madonna of college football . . . \" (NYT 1987/01/02/0000431). We would like to refer \"the Madonna of college football\" to Jimmy Johnson, and, in particular, we want to avoid that Madonna is part of any coreference chain.\nIt could also help in new interesting question answering tasks, for example, \"Who is the Bill Gates of Japan?\", where the sentence \". . . Mr. Horie has made headline news with a success story that has turned him into the Bill Gates of Japan.\" (NYT 2006/01/19/1733197) could be one answer to this question.\nGenerally speaking, successful detection and resolution of VAs could be a further step towards full natural language understanding. Contribution. We propose the first effective fully automated approaches for extracting VAs from texts. In our evaluation, we compare them against a baseline and assess the difficulty of identifying VAs using crowdsourcing. In addition, we extend the only existing larger data set (Fischer and J\u00e4schke, 2019) with VAs of eight additional patterns. We have also double-checked and corrected existing and new annotations. Our code and data are freely 3 available 4 and easily extensible towards other patterns and entity types.", "Introduction", "introduction"], ["b7a94c0422f863b0daeaf7554434023d0517d04b_2", "Very similar to metaphor detection (Tsvetkov et al., 2014;Gao et al., 2018;Mao et al., 2018), identifying VAs is a difficult task. So far, we are dealing with manually curated collections like the Wall Street Journal's collection of occurrences of \"Michael Jordans of . . . \" (Cohen et al., 2015). The only attempt automating the extraction has been presented by Fischer and J\u00e4schke (2019). Their semi-automatic approach for English texts extracts VA candidates for only one single pattern, the EN-TITY of. Using a regular expression to identify candidates, names and aliases of Wikidata entities whose 'instance-of' property is 'human' as a first filter, and a manually created blacklist as second filter, they extract about 3,700 VA candidates. 70% of them have been confirmed as VAs by a domain expert.\nSince the phenomenon is a kind of metonymy, its detection is closely related to approaches to metonymy resolution. This has been covered extensively, specifically by Markert and Nissim, for example, in (Nissim and Markert, 2003). They compare this task to word-sense disambiguation and propose a thesaurus-based classification approach. Figures of speech that have been covered include, for instance, metaphors (Tsvetkov et al., 2014;Gao et al., 2018;Mao et al., 2018) and irony (Akhtyrska, 2014). The supervised approach of Tsvetkov et al. (2014), for instance, can quite reliably \"discriminate whether a syntactic construction is meant literally or metaphorically\" but is very specific, focused on subject-verb-object and adjective-noun phrases.", "Related Work", "background"], ["b7a94c0422f863b0daeaf7554434023d0517d04b_3", "To create a corpus of candidate phrases and manually confirmed VAs, we use the dataset of Fischer and J\u00e4schke (2019) as starting point and their method as baseline. However, instead of relying only on one individual syntactic pattern, the EN-TITY of, we extended the candidate generation process with the patterns the ENTITY among, the EN-TITY for, and six variations thereof where the is pattern regex Wikidata blacklist true VA  replaced by a or an, respectively. We identified these patterns to be the most prevalent patterns in a preliminary analysis of a manually maintained collection of VAs.\nUsing the New York Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008)  Using Wikidata for distant supervision, we keep only candidates whose string matches the exact name or alias of Wikidata entities, respecting the case of letters, with 'instance-of' property 'human', and exclude candidates using the manually curated blacklist 5 provided by Fischer and J\u00e4schke (2019). 6 We consider this procedure of \"regex -Wikidata -blacklist\" as baseline. In Table 1, we show the number of VA candidate phrases after each step.\nIn addition, all remaining candidates were manually annotated by a domain expert with 10 years of experience in the research of VAs and samples were double-checked by a trained student. The resulting corpus contains 6,072 VA candidates, 3,023 of them were classified to be true VAs by the human annotators. That is, the baseline approach has a precision of 49.8% (see Table 1).

Thus, after the regex step and linking the source candidates with the Wikidata list of humans as in the baseline approach, we assess their popularity within Wikidata.\nThe rationale is that a prerequisite for being a source of a VA expression is to be famous or popular or notorious for something. Otherwise, the VA is less likely to be understood by a reader. This arguably goes along with being present on several of the almost 300 international Wikipedia versions. Therefore, we remove source candidates whose name also matches the label or alias of a non-human Wikidata entity that has more sitelinks 7 (i.e., is more popular according to our measure) than the linked human. For instance, the candidate 'the House of', that matched the American botanist Homer Doliver House 8 in the first step, will be removed since in the second step the entity 'house' 9 (the building, not the botanist) has more sitelinks (178 > 9). The popularity measure could easily be changed to any other measure like statements or using Wikipedia clickstream data.\nIn addition, we remove all candidates where the source (e.g., 'Prince') together with multiple words following it (e.g., 'of Wales') match the name or alias of another Wikidata entity (https: //www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43274). This allows us to remove frequent false positives like 'Prince of Wales'.", "Wikidata (WD)", "background"], ["b7a94c0422f863b0daeaf7554434023d0517d04b_6", "This approach is built on the regex step from the baseline approach as well, but we replace the way of identifying 'persons': instead of restricting the extraction to VAs with Wikidata entities, we per-form Named Entity Recognition on the sentence candidates using the Stanford three-class named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005).\nWhen all words of the candidate source (i.e., the words between the first and the last word of the regular expression match) are tagged as 'PERSON', we consider the candidate a positive match.
