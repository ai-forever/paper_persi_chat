Owing to the popularity of the situational comedy (sitcom) genre, it contributes significantly to the overall development of society. In an effort to analyze the content of television shows belonging to this genre, we present a dataset of dialogue turns from popular sitcoms annotated for the presence of sexist remarks. We train a text classification model to detect sexism using domain adaptive learning. We apply the model to our dataset to analyze the evolution of sexist content over the years. We propose a domain-specific semi-supervised architecture for the aforementioned detection of sexism. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model often yields better classification performance over generic deep learning based sentence classification that does not employ domain-specific training. We find that while sexism decreases over time on average, the proportion of sexist dialogue for the most sexist sitcom actually increases. . A quantitative analysis along with a detailed error analysis presents the case for our proposed methodology.", "abstract", "abstract"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_1", "Apart from being one of the most popular genres on television 1 , sitcoms also attract the adolescent viewership 2 and thus play a vital role in the formation of their thought process (Villani, 2001). Sink and Mastro (2017) argue that documenting the prevalence and quality of television representations of women is a valuable endeavor as television depictions of women is known to influence attitudes and beliefs towards gender. Therefore, these shows would ideally contain a minimal amount of sexist content. However, according to Lee et al. (2019a) and O'Kelly (1974), this may not be the case. For this reason, we present a dataset consisting of dialogue turns labeled as either 'sexist' or 'neutral'. We also build a system that automatically detects instances of sexism present in the dialogue of popular sitcoms. Thus, we attempt to use machine learning to document the gap between activism and social change.\nOften, a lack of labeled data can present a considerable challenge for text classification systems. Manual annotation often requires domain knowledge and may be expensive and time-consuming for large datasets. Manual annotation also carries the risk of introducing new annotator biases, privacybreaches, discrimination, and misunderstanding (Chowdhury et al., 2019). Although dialogue is not the only way that sexism is constructed in TV shows (Brewington, 2019;Mouka and Saridakis, 2015), the more subtle signs of discrimination can be more difficult to detect and analyze. Our work addresses issues of manual annotation by using semi-supervised learning to generate a dataset in a new domain of pseudo-labels from unlabelled data to detect sexism in TV dialogue. This minimizes the need for a manual annotation process while creating large datasets.\nWe make use of a previously published dataset (Waseem and Hovy, 2016) to create a semisupervised domain adapted classifier. In general, domain adaptation uses labeled data in one or more source domains to solve new tasks in a target domain. It is a sub-category of transfer learning. Since there is a lack of television show scripts annotated for sexism, we attempt a semi-supervised approach to develop our dataset. Here, our source domain consists of tweets from Waseem and Hovy's (2016)'s 'Hate Speech Twitter Annotations' dataset and our target domain is the dialogue in popular sitcoms. These two domains are quite different. Tweets are usually short, full of abbreviations, urban slang and grammatical errors. On the other hand, sitcom dialogue turns are descriptive, long, grammatically correct and contextually dependent on the dialogue turns that precede them. These differences warrant the need for a semi-supervised approach in our methodology.", "Introduction", "introduction"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_2", "In the growing body of literature on the automatic detection of sexism in text on social media, Twitter, in particular, has been the object of study and dataset creation.\nWaseem and Hovy (2016) created a dataset containing Racist and Sexist tweets. Following this, there have been various efforts towards detecting sexism in English tweets (Sharifirad et al., 2019), (Jha and Mamidi, 2017). (Mishra et al., 2018). Recently, Chiril et al. (2020) developed a dataset for sexism detection in French tweets. While the study of sexism in TV shows has received little attention in natural language processing Lee et al. (2019b), Gala et al. (2020), Xu et al. (2019), it has received significant attention in the field of gender studies (Sink and Mastro, 2017;Glascock, 2003). In gender studies, Sink and Mastro (2017) conducted a quantitative analysis to document portrayals of women and men on prime-time television and Glascock (2003) examines the perception of gender roles on network prime-time television programming. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has presented a comprehensive dataset for the presence of sexism in TV shows has been created. While efforts have been made to analyse the presence of sexism in TV shows (Nayef, 2016), the question of developing a machine learning based detection system for identifying sexism in scripted TV dialogue remains under-explored. However, Semi-supervised learning has received a lot of attention from the NLP community (Zhai et al., 2019;Xie et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2020). Our method most closely resembles Unsupervised Data Augmentation (Xie et al., 2019), which uses labeled data to annotate unlabeled samples under low resource settings.", "Related Work", "background"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_4", "The dataset used for this experiment consists of three parts. The first part is the data used for our training dataset. We use a dataset annotated for sexist tweets Waseem and Hovy (2016). To ensure that the classifier can identify non-sexist dialogue correctly, we append 2, 000 tweets that are nonsexist in nature obtained from a web application named 'Tweet Sentiment to CSV'. 3 Before appending these neutral tweets to the dataset, they were manually checked and any tweets that were not in English were removed, along with any ambiguous tweets. To account for our target domain, we collect the dialogues from twenty sitcoms crossreferenced by popularity 4 and script availability 5 . From this set of dialogue scripts, we randomly sample 1, 937 dialogue turns to manually annotate (see subsection 3.2 for annotation guidelines). The final training set consists of 3, 011 tweets labeled as sexist, 2, 000 tweets labeled as neutral, 203 sexist dialogue turns and 926 neutral dialogue turns, henceforth denoted as D train .\nFor the second part of the dataset, we use the un-annotated dialogue turns from the TV shows to perform semi-supervised learning. We call this dataset D semisupervised . Out of these, ten shows aired between 1985 and 1999 (old shows) and ten shows aired between 2000 and 2015 (new shows).\nThe third part of our dataset, which is manually annotated and used as a held-out test set, consists of 805 manually annotated dialogues, 411 of that are labeled as neutral and 394 as sexist. This data was annotated by four annotators, achieving a Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960) of 0.87.", "Collection", "background"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_5", "In this section, we describe the guidelines followed during the annotation process. The guidelines of what classifies a tweet as sexist were defined by Waseem and Hovy (2016). We use Glick and Fiske's (1996) definition of sexism to annotate dialogue turns from popular sitcoms. According to this definition, there are three primary dimensions within sexism. ders to justify social distinctions. An example of a sexist dialogue turn under this dimension is: \"I think women just have a lower threshold for pain than men.' (Joey Tribbiani, Friends)\n\u2022 Male Gaze: Male Gaze refers to viewing women as sexual objects. An example of a sexist dialogue turn under this dimension is: \"All men want is to see women naked.\" (Jerry Seinfeld, Seinfeld)\nApart from this, we have also included dialogue turns that include derogatory terms against women (James (1998)) and dialogue turns that justify stereotypes against women or gender roles (Lauzen et al. (2008)). E.g. \"See? Strong women always turn out to be nightmares\" (Seinfeld) and \"Look I'm sorry but some things are different for men and women.\" (Chandler Bing, Friends) We find that within the annotated sexist dialogues in our held-out test set, 27.9% of the dialogues fall under gender differentiation sexism, 33.7% of the dialogues fall under paternalism and 38.4% under male gaze.", "Definition of Sexism", "background"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_6", "The following steps were taken as a part of the preprocessing process:\n\u2022 The names of the characters who said the dialogue were removed from each dialogue turn, to avoid any undue dataset bias pertaining to character names,\n\u2022 Lines in the transcripts that were not dialogue turns, such as bracketed expressions to convey the settings or scenes, were removed,\n\u2022 Any numbers that appeared in dialogue turns were removed,\n\u2022 All words were converted to lowercase, tokenized and lemmatized.", "Preprocessing", "background"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_7", "We begin by training a set of models on D train (section 3.1) to find the best performing model. We make use of a support vector machine (SVM), a logistic regression classifier (LR), a random forest ensemble (RF), a naive Bayes classifier (NB) , fine-tuned BERT, and a bi-directional LSTM (bi-LSTM). We find that the bi-LSTM outperforms the other models by 3.4%, with an accuracy of 76.03% on the held-out test set, D test . Thus, we make use of the bi-LSTM in our proposed semi-supervised approach.\nOut of the 20 sitcom show scripts we collect, we use four, namely 'Friends', 'The Big Bang Theory', 'How I Met Your Mother' and 'Seinfeld' for manual annotation (see section 3.1 for more detail). Next, we use the baseline bi-LSTM to make predictions on the other 16 show scripts. Out of these, eight are new shows and the other eight are old shows. The model classifies 1, 639 dialogue turns as sexist. To form D semisupervised , we add all dialogue turns identified as sexist by the baseline model and randomly sample 31, 944 dialogue turns from the 242, 108 dialogue turns identified as neutral. We combine D train and D semisupervised to form D f inal 6 .\nFinally, we train a bi-LSTM on D f inal . We make use of the softmax activation function and the categorical cross entropy loss function while training this bi-LSTM. It consists of an embedding layer, a spatial dropout layer and makes use of the Adam optimizer, with a dropout equal to 0.2. This bi-LSTM attains an accuracy of 83.0% on D test . To offer a fair comparison, we also train other competitive models on D f inal . Table 1 demonstrates the performance of these models on D test across six evaluation metrics.\nTo offer some insight on how the amount of sex-  ist content in the form of dialogue has developed over the years, we use our proposed model to classify the dialogue turns of all twenty shows.", "Experiment Setup", "experiments"], ["503e089a4413900a7d930a9b8d43b29796dedb1e_9", "In comparing the baseline bi-directional LSTM model trained on D train and the proposed model trained on D f inal , we observe a gain of 7% in terms of accuracy on D test .

However, it is worth noting that in the shows aired between 1985 and 1999, the show with the greatest percentage of sexist dialogue turns has 2.61% sexist dialogue turns while the proportion of sexist dialogue turns is 4.13% for the worst offender after the turn of the century.

For example: \"And yet you're the one always getting spanked.\" (Two and a Half Men) This may be because a lot of sentences that contain sexual terms in the underlying datasets are sexist. For instance, dialogue turns in the training dataset like \"Well, most women want to be banged.\" (How I met your Mother) and \"Sit with her, hold her, comfort her and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.\" (The Big Bang Theory) are sexist.\n\u2022 Marriages Dialogues that mention women and marriages or weddings are marked as sexist in some cases. For example: \"I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.\" (Friends) This can be attributed to a lack of contextual understanding in the classifier. Perhaps because there aren't that many dialogue turns that mention weddings or marriages.\n\u2022 Gendered pronouns for objects In some cases, the pronoun 'she' is used to refer to objects like vehicles and boats and appear as sexist to the classifier.
